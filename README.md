We are trying to answer following Questions:
- For a Particular Customer 'X', Which of our product 'Yi' is the best fit from a set of Y=[Y1,Y2,.....,Yn] products? 
- Can we find new probable customers which have same buisness needs/requirements as the existing customers?

Info. about v1:

- Make a sample ML model for Predicting suitable solution(Product) on the basis of test parameters.
- Input = n-number of Parameters
- Output = Product Class Probability

## ToDo: 
- Get good dataset, else prepare.
- Catboost in our case[Spike]
- Check for other Models.
- Improve Accuracy.
